# Card game:

Card game developed in Swift where two players draw cards, and the player with the higher card value earns a point.
The game also determines a player's position (east or west) based on their location.

## Features
1. User Registration: Players enter their name, saved using UserDefaults.
2. Geolocation: The game determines if the player is east or west of the midpoint (34.817549168324334) and saves this information.
3. Card Drawing: Each card has a value. The player with the higher card value wins the round and gets a point. If both cards have the same value, no points are awarded.
4. Rounds: The game consists of 10 rounds. After 10 rounds, the game displays the winner's name and score.
5. Restart Game: Players can restart the game after it ends.
